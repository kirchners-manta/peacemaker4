Peacemaker 4 - Documentation
=============================

Peacemaker uses the laws of statistical thermodynamics to calculate the thermodynamic properties 
of pure liquids and liquid mixtures.
It is based on the **Q**\uantum **C**\luster **E**\quilibrium (**QCE**) theory, which is the idea, that 
the liquid bulk system can be described as a dense distribution of statistically reoccurring
molecular cluster motifs.
